This little project aims to map choirs in Berlin.



## Content

At the moment the site contains 4 sections on the main site:

### 1. Section: Map
This section contains a map of Berlin with all choirs which are currently in the database.

Click [here](http://zfhui.de/blag/?p=2673) to read about how I generated the web map.

### 2. Section: Add my choir form
If a visiter wants his/her choir to be added to the map, he/she can fill out the form. An email will then be send to the admin (me), to ask for my approval.

### 3. Section: About this site
A short description about this site.

### 4. Section: Footnote
Login link for the admin and more utility links shows up, after the log in.
